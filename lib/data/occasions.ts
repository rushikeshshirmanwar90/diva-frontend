 * The storefront's collections are the backend's occasions.

 * seven chips an admin ticks under "Occasions" on the add-product page. Tagging
 * a product there is what puts it in the matching edit here, so the shelves
 * fill themselves rather than needing a second "collection" assigned by hand.
 *
 * This file is deliberately *not* `server-only`: the header and the filter
 * panel are client components and read the same list, so the nav, the chips
 * and the collection pages can never disagree about what an occasion is called.
